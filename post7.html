  <h1>⚔️ Anime vs Manga – Which One Is Better in 2025?</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Anime and manga have always shared a deep connection, yet they remain two very different experiences for fans. As we step into 2025, the debate continues stronger than ever — which one is better?</p>

    <h3>📺 Anime: The Visual Experience</h3>
    <p>Anime continues to dominate in 2025 with its vibrant animation, music, and voice acting. Studios like MAPPA, Ufotable, and Wit are pushing boundaries with cinematic scenes, fluid combat, and deep emotional moments. Anime makes it easier for new fans to enter the world of a story and get instantly hooked.</p>

    <h3>📖 Manga: The Purest Form of Storytelling</h3>
    <p>Many fans argue that manga is the raw, unfiltered version of the creator’s vision. You get ahead of the anime, explore deeper arcs (sometimes skipped in anime), and enjoy high-detail artwork at your own pace. Manga is cheaper, portable, and doesn’t suffer from filler episodes or pacing problems.</p>

    <h3>⚖️ Verdict?</h3>
    <p>There’s no one answer. Anime is perfect for those who enjoy dynamic storytelling and sound, while manga is ideal for readers who crave full control and pure plot. In 2025, both formats are thriving and often complement each other beautifully.</p>

    <p>So, which one wins for you in 2025 — the moving masterpiece or the inked original? Either way, the anime world has never looked better!</p>
